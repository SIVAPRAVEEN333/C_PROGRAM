Types of sorting algorithms:
1.Selection Sort
2.Bubble sort
3.Insertion Sort
4.Merge Sort
5.Quick Sort
6.Heap sort
7.and tooo binary search!!!


selection sort:
*largest element is selected and swapped with the last element(in case of ascending order).
*fast compared to bubble sort
*Repeatedly finding the minimum element and swapping.
defintion:It basically determines the minimum (or maximum) of the list and swaps it with the element at the index where its supposed to be. 
	The process is repeated such that the nth minimum (or maximum) element is swapped with the element at the n-1th index of the list.
	The below is an implementation of the algorithm in C.



Bubble sort:
*adjacent element is compard and swapped
*slow compared to selection sort
*exchanging the data(highest)
*Swapping the adjacent elements
definition:Bubble Sort works by comparing each element of the list with the element next to it and swapping them if required. 
	With each pass, the largest of the list is “bubbled” to the end of the list whereas the smaller values sink to the bottom. 
	It is similar to selection sort although not as straight forward.
 	Instead of “selecting” maximum values, they are bubbled to a part of the list. An implementation in C.


Insertion Sort:
